That encounter led to the beginning of donations such as the KAIST-Indonesia Volunteer Corps, and the trust built through this relationship eventually extended to the KAIST 50th Anniversary Memorial Hall project, which was initiated around 2020 by President Sung-Chul Shin.\n\nWhile meeting various people involved in the 50th Anniversary Memorial Hall project, I had the opportunity to meet Professor Myung-Ho Kim, then Head of the School of Computing. At that time, I decided to dedicate a portion of the donation I had pledged to KAIST to the expansion of the School of Computing. Around that period, I also began exchanging thoughts with several fellow alumni and acquaintances, which ultimately led to KRAFTON’s 11 billion KRW matching grant donation in 2021.”",
