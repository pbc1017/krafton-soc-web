      "message": "““I first met Professor Young-Gul Kim, Executive Director of the KAIST Development Foundation, in October 2017. That encounter led to the beginning of donations such as the KAIST-Indonesia Volunteer Corps, and the trust built through this relationship eventually extended to the KAIST 50th Anniversary Memorial Hall project, which was initiated around 2020 by President Sung-Chul Shin.\n\nWhile meeting various people involved in the 50th Anniversary Memorial Hall project, I had the opportunity to meet Professor Myung-Ho Kim, then Head of the School of Computing. At that time, I decided to dedicate a portion of the donation I had pledged to KAIST to the expansion of the School of Computing. Around that period, I also began exchanging thoughts with several fellow alumni and acquaintances, which ultimately led to KRAFTON’s 11 billion KRW matching grant donation in 2021.”",

Rather than highlighting individual donors, the design subtly reflects their wish to leave a legacy for future generations.\n\nMessages engraved on a super mirror, nestled among the plants of the Reflective Jungle, respond to movement—shifting and reflecting—becoming part of an ongoing, shared experience."

        "text": "The donor nameplate is not a simple list of names. Each name connects to the next in a single line, symbolizing that giving is not a one-time act, but part of a virtuous, ongoing flow.\n\nMore than honoring donors, the design encourages the spirit of Pay It Forward to grow naturally. As students pass by, they remember the warmth of those who came before them—and imagine the day they, too, will leave their name on this line."

      "Card6": {
        "text": "We aimed to visually express how small donations come together to create greater meaning, and how connected hearts open up new possibilities. Through this plate, we didn’t want to leave just a record—we hoped to create a space where positive impact continues, without end."

      "Card7": {
        "text": "As a subtle donor space that doesn’t rely on explanation, we applied a bolder design approach—creating strong, object-like elements and spatial presence to intuitively convey the message to users.\n\nTo realize Intuitive Continuity, we used the material and texture of concrete to unify the space as a single language—not as a purely aesthetic choice, but to ensure spatial consistency and lasting presence."

        "text": "Rather than creating a closed-off space for students, the design connects inside and outside through five overlapping layers—external landscaping, concrete table, indoor greenery, wooden floor seating, and exterior stone landscaping—allowing visual flow and openness throughout the space."

      "Card10": {
        "text": "Previously blocked windows were redesigned as large, openable ones—reflecting the idea of “opening boundaries within” to foster connection and face-to-face interaction.\n\nThis space allows students to sit, lie down, look outside, or step out freely—encouraging a sense of autonomy. Just as the body feels free here, we hoped the mind would also expand, opening up new ways of thinking."

It began with a generous donation from KRAFTON alumni and employees, and since then, more and more alumni, professors, and even current students have joined the movement.\nWhat drives this wave of giving is gratitude—gratitude for the open and free communication fostered by brilliant professors and inspiring students, for a space where diverse individuals could feel at ease in their differences, and for the time when we could dream freely and boldly.\nThough we can never fully repay our teachers and peers who gave us those precious moments and that nurturing space, we can pay it forward. This is a space of connection where we share our gratitude with the next generation. I hope that in this space, free spirits will soar and spark innovations that lead to a happier world for all.”",
